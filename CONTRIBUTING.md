# Introduction

### Welcome!

Thanks for considering contributing campus-mobile. This is a fairly new project and we would like to get as many people involved as possible. 

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

### Contributions
There are tons of improvements/enhancements so don't worry about running out of things to do. There are many ways to contribute, such as improving our documentation, submitting bug reports/fixes, submitting feature requests, or writing code that can be incorporated into the app itself.

# Ground Rules
* Please be respectful and considerate to each other
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Ensure any code changes are compatible and appropriate for both Android and iOS platforms (Please ask for help if there is anything you are unsure of, because of the nature of React Native, each platform has its own quirks)

# Your First Contribution
### Set up your environment
- Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for React Native 
- From the project folder, run:
	- npm install
	- npm run-script apply-fixes
- For iOS, from the project folder, run: react-native run-ios
- For Android, from the project folder, run: react-native run-android

### Find something to do
- Documenting components/functions (Please follow [jsdoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) style)
- We're still working on it, but we will begin submitting and tagging more github issues. Look for tags: documentation, beginner, feature request
- Still can't find something you would like to work on? Suggest something! This app is far from being complete and we will do our best to take every suggestion into consideration while developing.

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
The goal of this platform is to provide a responsive and intuitive native mobile interactions for a personalized campus experience.

We have a slew of features and enhancements planned for the future of the app. We try to keep everything organized within github, so if you don't see something, it's probably because we haven't thought of it yet! 

Note: We have cool student info related features planned, but are waiting on a Single Sign On solution.

Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code Review Process
There's currently really only two of us looking at pull requests, but that may change in the future. We will try to do our best to respond to pull requests as soon as we can. 

# Community
We would like to keep most conversations relating to the app on github, but we do have a slack channel. // TODO: Add slack channel info and joining info?

# Styling
We've defined a set of [eslint](http://eslint.org/) rules for the project. There are plugins available for popular text editors to make it much easier to stick to these guidelines. 
- SublimeText [plugin](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Notepad++ [plugin](https://sourceforge.net/projects/notepad-linter/)
